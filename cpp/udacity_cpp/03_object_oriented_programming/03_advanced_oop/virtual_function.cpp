/* Virtual Functions
Polymorphism is one of the crucial components of OOP within C++. In this lab,
you'll use virtual methods and see their role in class interfaces and in the 
process of inheritance.

Virtual methods are declared (and possibly defined) in a base class, and are 
meant to be overridden by derived classes. This approach creates interfaces for 
your classes at the base level.

Here, you'll start with a Shape class as the base class for geometrical 2D 
entities. Geometrical shapes (closed curves) can be described by an area and the
length of their perimeter. area and perimeter_length should be methods of the 
base class interface. You'll declare each of these as virtual functions with a 
const = 0 flag to identify them as prototypes in the base class like this:
    class Shape {
        public:
            Shape() {}
            virtual double Area() const = 0;
            virtual double PerimeterLength() const = 0;
    };

We said that in the base class, virtual methods can but do not have to be 
implemented. If we delegate with instruction = 0 we are notifying compiler that
this (base) class doesnâ€™t have virtual method implementation but every other 
derived class is required to implement this method.
