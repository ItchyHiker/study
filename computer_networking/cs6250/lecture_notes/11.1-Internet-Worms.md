* Types of Viruses and Worms Overview
- virus:
  - infection of existing program that results in modification of original program behavior
  - requires user action to spread (opening an attachment, opening an exe)
- worm:
  - replicates and propogates across internet
  - usually spread by exploiting flaws in existing programs
  - replicate automatically

Types of viruses:
- parasitic virus: infects executables
- memory-resident virus: infects running programs
- boot-sector virus: spreads when system is booted
- polymorphic virus: encrypts part of the virus program with a randomly generated key

Differences between viruses and worms: viruses spread manually, worms spread automatically, so a worm can use any one of the above techniques to spread
* Internet Worm Lifecycle
1. infected machine scans for other vulnerable hosts
2. infect vulnerable host via remote exploit
3. remain undiscovered so that it can spread before being removed
* First Worm: "Morris Worm"
- designed by Rober Morris in 1988
- no malicious payload, but bogged down infected machines by spawning new processes and exhausting resources
- affected 10% of all internet hosts
- spread through three propogation vectors
  - cracked passwords using a small dictionary and a publicly readable password file, targeted hosts listed in trusted host file
  - buffer overflow vulnerability in finger daemon
  - debug command in sendmail
    - in sendmail, it was possible to execute code using an SMTP message
- worms typically have multiple vectors in order to facilitate spreading and increase speed
* Worm Outbreaks in Detail
- Summer 2001: new era in security with 3 major worm outbreaks
- code red 1
  - Jul 13, 2001
  - first modern worm
  - exploited buffer overflow in Microsoft's IIS
  - spread on the 1st and 20th of each month by finding new targets using a random IP scan
    - spawn 99 new threads, which generated IP addresses at random, and look for vulnerable IIS
  - Version 2:
    - released six days later
    - fixed random scanning bug
    - so that each instance of the worm scans a different IP space
    - compromised 350,000 hosts in 14 hrs
      - complete set of vulnerable IIS hosts on the entire internet
    - payload: mount DOS attack on whitehouse.gov
      - bug caused worm to die on 20th of each month, but it would resurrect itself on the first if the clock was wrong
      - the attack on whitehouse.gov targeted a particular IP address and not the domain name, so the operator just had to move the website to a different IP address
- code red 2
  - exploited same vulnerability but with different payload
  - released August 4, 2001
  - spread on Windows 2000, crashed on NT
  - scan preferred nearby addresses from same /8 with probability of 1/2, same /16 with probably of 3/8, and randomly from the internet with the remaining 1/8
    - reason for this preference: if there was one vulnerable host, then there's likely to be more, since the same admin might configure the other hosts the same way
      - speeds up infection since the probability of finding another vulnerable host increases
  - payload: IIS backdoor
  - dead by design by Oct 1, 2001
- Nimda
  - release Sep 18, 2001
  - spread using multiple vectors
    - IIS vulnerability
    - email attachment
    - installed in exploit code in malicious webpages
    - spread over local network
    - file infection
  - signature based protection didn't help because of its many ways of spreading
  - first worm to exploit a 0-day attack
* Modeling Fast-Spreading Worms
- dormant phase: slow spread
- inflection point at which infection rate becomes exponential
- infection plateaus once most of the vulnerables hosts have been found

- k: initial compromise rate
- N: # vulnerable hosts
- a: fraction of hosts already compromised

- Nda = Na * k(1-a) dt
- Nda = new infections in time interval dt
- k(1-a) = rate at which uninfected hosts become infected

\begin{equation}
\frac{e^{k*(t-T)}}{1te^{k(t-T)}}
\end{equation}

The main takeaway of this equation is that to maximize the number of infected hosts, we need to make k, the initial compromise rate,  as large as possible
* Increasing Compromise Rate
1. create a hit list, or a list of vulnerable hosts ahead of time
   - remember that the time it takes to infect the first 10,000 hosts dominates the infection time
   - scan or do recon before infection
2. permutation scan: every compromised host has a shared permutation of IP address lists.
   - starting from own IP and work down ensures that the compromised hosts don't duplicate work

Slammer Worm: Jan 2003
- exploited buffer overflow in Microsoft SQL server
- entire code fit in one UDP packet
  - connectionless: not limited by latency, only by bandwidth
- caused $1.2 billion in damages
- knocked out ATM, cell phones, five root DNS, airline processing
- no malicious payload, but caused resource exhaustion
