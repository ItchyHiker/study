* Spam
- Unwanted commercial email
- most spam goes to spam folder
- problem for network operators
  - need to design filters
  - mail servers still have to store the mail
  - security risk if the message contains a malicious payload (malware, phishing attack)
- 95% of all email is spam
- 1 in every 87 emails is a phishing attack
- 50,000 unique phishing attacks in a month

Filters
- how to differentiate bad messages (spam) from good messages (ham)
  - content-based: Viagara, rolex -> spam
    - easy to evade
      - different spellings
      - send content via photo or links instead of text
  - IP address of sender (blacklisting)
  - behavior (how the mail is sent - time of day, sent as a batch of emails of similar sizes)
* IP Blacklisting
- When a sender sends email, receiver sends query of IP to a blacklist
- receiver can decide to accept the message based on the results, terminate the connection, or reject the message
* Behavior
- geographic location of the sender and receiver
- set of target recipients
- sender's upstream ISP
- whether the sender is potentially a member of a botnet or is compromised
* Spam Blacklisting Cont'd
- evading a blacklist
  1. hijack IP prefix for a short period of time
  2. send spam within the prefix
  3. withdraw the prefix
- This ephemeral-ness of IP addresses renders blacklisting useless

There are many single-packet features that work well for filtering spam:
- distance b/w sender and receiver
- density of IP space in terms of how many other mail senders are nearby
- local time of day of sender
- AS of sender IP

Single message features: 
- number of recipients
- length of message

Aggregates (group of email messages):
- variation in length of messages

These features are put together in a system called SNARE (Spatio-Temporal Network-Level Automated Reputation Engine)
- 70% detection rate
- FP rate of 1/10 of 1%
